## üìö Libraries and Technologies Used

### Core Framework

- **Next.js 15.4.5** - React framework with app router and server-side rendering
- **React 19** - UI library with modern hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development with strict configurations

### State Management

- **Zustand 5.0.2** - Lightweight state management with persistence middleware
- **@tanstack/react-query 5.62.2** - Server state management and caching

### Mapping and Visualization

- **Leaflet 1.9.4** - Interactive map library
- **React-Leaflet 4.2.1** - React components for Leaflet
- **Leaflet-Geoman 2.17.0** - Advanced polygon drawing and editing tools

### UI Components and Styling

- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.1** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI** - Accessible, unstyled UI primitives
  - @radix-ui/react-slider - Timeline control component
  - @radix-ui/react-select - Dropdown selections
- **Lucide React 0.468.0** - Modern icon library
- **clsx & tailwind-merge** - Conditional CSS class utilities

### Weather Data

- **Open-Meteo API** - Free weather API providing temperature and wind speed data

### Development Tools

- **ESLint** - Code linting with Next.js configuration
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing and Tailwind integration

## üèóÔ∏è Design and Development Remarks

### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management Strategy**

   - Zustand chosen for its simplicity and TypeScript support
   - Persistence middleware ensures data survives page refreshes
   - Centralized store with clear action patterns

2. **Map Implementation**

   - Dynamic imports to avoid SSR issues with Leaflet
   - Dual polygon management: Geoman for creation, custom renderer for persistence
   - Efficient layer cleanup to prevent memory leaks

3. **Weather Data Flow**

   - Cached API responses with 30-minute staleness check
   - Batch processing for multiple polygons
   - Error handling with retry logic

4. **Component Architecture**
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Custom hooks for complex state logic
   - Reusable UI components with Radix primitives

### Technical Highlights

- **Performance**: Optimized bundle with dynamic imports and code splitting
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant components with keyboard navigation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation for API failures

### Development Challenges Solved

1. **SSR Compatibility**: Leaflet requires client-side only rendering
2. **Polygon Synchronization**: Managing both Geoman and custom layers
3. **Timeline Performance**: Efficient date calculations for large datasets
4. **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design with touch-friendly controls
